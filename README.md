# Cyber-Projects

An educational repository containing beginner Python scripts related to cybersecurity concepts, network security, automation, and hands-on practice. This collection demonstrates various network security tools and utilities built with Python.

**⚠️ Disclaimer**: These tools are for educational and authorized testing purposes only. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal.

## Projects Overview

### 1. [Port Scanner](Port%20Scanner)

A multi-threaded TCP port scanner that identifies open and closed ports on target hosts.

**Features:**
- Fast parallel scanning using 50 concurrent threads
- Scans common ports 1-1024
- Supports both IP addresses and hostname resolution
- Thread-safe output with clean result display
- Sorted results for easy analysis

**Key Technologies**: `socket`, `threading`, `Queue`
